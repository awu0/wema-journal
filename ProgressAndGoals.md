# Goals and requirements
Set out your goals for this semester. Please detail what the requirement is that each goals will meet, and how you expect to meet it.

## Users
- [ ] Each user can create and delete their own accounts (sign up and login)
- [ ] Editors is like admin
- [ ] Audit log for each user
- [ ] A section to see all users (maybe only admins)

We will code a webpage to do these, exposing the correct endpoints and making sure of the user roles in the backend.
